I'm a "data scientist", but also a biochemist (currently finished a PhD program in a biological science: Immunology, you can see my biological CV clicking `here </ShortCV_English.pdf>`__) from the U.N.L.P. - Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm also a TA in Immunology courses at U.N.L.P. and I taught biostatistics courses at the Colegio de Bioqu√≠micos - Colegio Zonal XII - Buenos Aires. I'm a member of Python Argentina (PyAr) [1] and Quantitative Finance Club (QFClub) [2].

My main focus is the quantitative financial time series research and analysis using Python as the main computational tool. But, I also develop several data science, computer vision, and IPython-related projects.
 
Recently, I have presented talks and posters in several international and national conferences: 

* PyConUS 2012 ([3 - 6]), SciPy 2013 ([7 - 10]).
* PyDay Lujan 2012 [11], PyConAr 2011 ([12 - 13]), PyConAr 2012 ([14 - 15]), SciPyConAr 2013 ([16 - 19]).

In the open development area, I can list the following projects:

* IPython plugin for NINJA-IDE, which gives IPython notebook support to this IDE (written and focused in Python) [20].
* vIPer (based in the plugin described before), an independent application with several features focused to the visualization and publication of the IPython notebooks [21].

and also some contributions to other projects:

* IPython project, with development ideas, specially in the nbconvert repository, providing support for the generation of static html-slideshows from IPython notebooks [22 - 23(demo)]. 
* Nikola, a static site generator, providing support for publishing posts with IPython notebooks, a "smart" mathjax loader and a new reveal.js-based theme [24 - 25].
