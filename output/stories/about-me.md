### SHORT BIO

Hi! I'm a **biomedical engineer**, but also an IT enthusiast currently involved in a *PhD program* in biomedical engineering at the **University of Pisa** (UNIPI), Pisa, Italy. 
<br/>
<br/>
I got my BSc at Marche's Politechnic University (*UNIVPM*), Ancona (Italy) in 2011 and then my MSc at the University of Pisa (*UNIPI*) in 2015 (you can see a short version of my CV clicking [here](../CV_eng_short.pdf) or a longer one [here](../CV_eng_long.pdf).
<br/>
<br/>
Since a couple of months I am member of the Europen Society for Molecular Imaging ([ESMI](http://www.e-smi.eu/)).
<br/>
<br/>
My main research topic is about the **quantitative analysis** of dynamic time series of PET images, with a particular focus on **direct kinetic modeling** and **clustering** of *raw* sinogram data.
