<p>I'm a biomedical engineer, but also an IT enthusiast currently involved in a PhD program in biomedical engineering (you can see my CV clicking <a class="reference external" href="../files/CV_eng_short.pdf">here</a>) at the University of Pisa (UNIPI), Pisa, Italy. I'm also a TA in Immunology courses at U.N.L.P. and I taught biostatistics courses at the Colegio de Bioqu√≠micos - Colegio Zonal XII - Buenos Aires. I'm a member of Python Argentina (PyAr) [1] and Quantitative Finance Club (QFClub) [2].</p>
<p>My main focus is the quantitative financial time series research and analysis using Python as the main computational tool. But, I also develop several data science, computer vision, and IPython-related projects.</p>
<p>Recently, I have presented talks and posters in several international and national conferences:</p>

<li>EMIM 2016</li>
<li>MEDICON 2016</li>
</ul>
