<p>I'm a biomedical engineer, but also an IT enthusiast (currently involved in a PhD program in biomedical engineering, you can see my CV clicking <a class="reference external" href="/ShortCV_English.pdf">here</a>) from the UNIPI - University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy. I'm also a TA in Immunology courses at U.N.L.P. and I taught biostatistics courses at the Colegio de Bioqu√≠micos - Colegio Zonal XII - Buenos Aires. I'm a member of Python Argentina (PyAr) [1] and Quantitative Finance Club (QFClub) [2].</p>
<p>My main focus is the quantitative financial time series research and analysis using Python as the main computational tool. But, I also develop several data science, computer vision, and IPython-related projects.</p>
<p>Recently, I have presented talks and posters in several international and national conferences:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PyConUS 2012 ([3 - 6]), SciPy 2013 ([7 - 10]).</li>
<li>PyDay Lujan 2012 [11], PyConAr 2011 ([12 - 13]), PyConAr 2012 ([14 - 15]), SciPyConAr 2013 ([16 - 19]).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the open development area, I can list the following projects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>IPython plugin for NINJA-IDE, which gives IPython notebook support to this IDE (written and focused in Python) [20].</li>
<li>vIPer (based in the plugin described before), an independent application with several features focused to the visualization and publication of the IPython notebooks [21].</li>
</ul>
<p>and also some contributions to other projects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>IPython project, with development ideas, specially in the nbconvert repository, providing support for the generation of static html-slideshows from IPython notebooks [22 - 23(demo)].</li>
<li>Nikola, a static site generator, providing support for publishing posts with IPython notebooks, a &quot;smart&quot; mathjax loader and a new reveal.js-based theme [24 - 25].</li>
</ul>
