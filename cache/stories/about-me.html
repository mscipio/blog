<p>I'm a biomedical engineer, but also an IT enthusiast currently involved in a PhD program in biomedical engineering at the University of Pisa (UNIPI), Pisa, Italy.</p>
<p>I got my B.Sc. at Marche's Politechnic University (UNIVPM), Ancona, Italy in 2011 and then my M.Sc. the University of Pisa (UNIPI) in 2015 (you can see a short version of my CV clicking <a class="reference external" href="../CV_eng_short.pdf">here</a> or a longer one <a class="reference external" href="../CV_eng_long.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>Since a couple of months I am member of the Europen Society for Molecular Imaging (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.e-smi.eu/">ESMI</a>).</p>
<p>My main research topic is about the quantitative analysis of dynamic time series of PET images, with a particular focus on direct kinetic modeling and clustering of raw sinogram data.</p>
