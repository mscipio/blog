I'm a biomedical engineer, but also an IT enthusiast currently involved in a PhD program in biomedical engineering (you can see my CV clicking `here <../files/CV_eng _short.pdf>`__) at the University of Pisa (UNIPI), Pisa, Italy. I'm also a TA in Immunology courses at U.N.L.P. and I taught biostatistics courses at the Colegio de Bioqu√≠micos - Colegio Zonal XII - Buenos Aires. I'm a member of Python Argentina (PyAr) [1] and Quantitative Finance Club (QFClub) [2].

My main focus is the quantitative financial time series research and analysis using Python as the main computational tool. But, I also develop several data science, computer vision, and IPython-related projects.
 
Recently, I have presented talks and posters in several international and national conferences: 

* EMIM 2016
* MEDICON 2016

Publications:

* `Pharmacokinetic analysis of dynamic PET data: comparison between direct parametric reconstruction and conventional indirect voxel-based estimation <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299851553_Pharmacokinetic_analysis_of_dynamic_PET_data_comparison_between_direct_parametric_reconstruction_and_conventional_indirect_voxel-based_estimation>`__
* `The Influence of Noise in Dynamic PET Direct Reconstruction <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299843191_The_Influence_of_Noise_in_Dynamic_PET_Direct_Reconstruction>`__
