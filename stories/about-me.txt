I'm a biomedical engineer, but also an IT enthusiast currently involved in a PhD program in biomedical engineering at the University of Pisa (UNIPI), Pisa, Italy. 


I got my B.Sc. at Marche's Politechnic University (UNIVPM), Ancona, Italy in 2011 and then my M.Sc. the University of Pisa (UNIPI) in 2015 (you can see a short version of my CV clicking `here <../files/CV_eng_short.pdf>`__ or a longer one `here <../files/CV_eng_long.pdf>`__).


Since a couple of months I am member of the Europen Society for Molecular Imaging (`ESMI <http://www.e-smi.eu/>`__).


My main research topic is about the quantitative analysis of dynamic time series of PET images, with a particular focus on direct kinetic modeling and clustering of raw sinogram data.
